        id="OldTargetApi"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility &#xA;modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. &#xA;Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details."

        summary="Target SDK attribute is not targeting latest version"
        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version you are adding support for: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html"

        message="A newer version of junit:junit than 4.12 is available: 4.13.2"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="4"
        summary="Obsolete Gradle Dependency"
        explanation="This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find."

        id="ClickableViewAccessibility"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Custom view `CompactCalendarView` overrides `onTouchEvent` but not `performClick`"
        category="Accessibility"
        priority="6"
        summary="Accessibility in Custom Views"
        explanation="If a `View` that overrides `onTouchEvent` or uses an `OnTouchListener` does not also implement `performClick` and call it when clicks are detected, the `View` may not handle accessibility actions properly. Logic handling the click actions should ideally be placed in `View#performClick` as some accessibility services invoke `performClick` when a click action should occur."
